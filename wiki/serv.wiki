==Introduction==
The Semantic Web prides itself in being a platform for representing any kind of entity, whether they be classes (e.g. person), relations (e.g. loves) or individuals (e.g. you), and constructing statements to describe them (e.g. `<the moon> <is made of> <cheese>` ). The basic idea of linked data is to use URIs to name things and link them together, and use web technology to obtain documents that contain this information. This is great if you are an original data provider - you can publish documents on your web site that describe entities that you name and offer resolution services for. However, increasing numbers of people also want to make statements about primary data, and we'd also like to discover their documents for the statements contained within. Unfortunately, it's rather hard to find these documents coming out from the original data provider because there is no mechanism to automatically discover reciprocal links nor what they really mean.  

To illustrate, let's look at how [http://www.wikipedia.org Wikipedia] and [http://dbpedia.org DBPedia] treat the topic "Planet". "Planet" is a topic in Wikipedia, and _is the subject of_ Wikipedia's HTML page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet]. DBPedia, which obtains its raw data from structured information in Wikipedia articles, actually offers several different types of documents (HTML, RDF/N3, RDF/XML, JSON+RDF). DBPedia's HTML page about Wikipedia's Planet topic can be found at [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planet http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planet] and this contains the statement that the entity identified by 
[http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planet http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planet] _is the topic of_ Wikipedia's HTML page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet], as specified with FOAF's [http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_page foaf:page] relation. However, the network of information is incomplete. What isn't being said is i) that DBPedia's entity is also the topic of DBPedia's document, and ii) DBPedia's entity is the same as the entity referred to in Wikipedia's Document. The problem for ii) is that there is only one source of information for Wikipedia's "Planet" -> the HTML page, and we don't know another URI for Wikipedia's entity that goes by the name "Planet". 

While the word "Planet" has many meanings to many people, Wikipedia's article about the topic is clear. It would be useful to have a unique identifier for Wikipedia's Planet topic. Since Wikipedia isn't generating URIs for its concepts, we might use something like "wikipedia:Planet". This works because the word "Planet" is unique in Wikipedia and "wikipedia" can be recognized as a globally unique *namespace* for Wikepedia topics. By building a registry around these dataset identifiers and entity identifiers, we could automatically generate links to a data provisioner's documents using some URI pattern that they specify. In this way, original and third data providers could register their entity resolution capability with the types of documents they provide (eg HTML, RDF/N3, RDF/XML). This then can act as a linked data bridge for documents the entities they contain information about. 

==Objective==
The purpose of the Semantic Entity Resolution Vocabulary (SERV) is to facilitate the representation of entities contained in namespace-identified datasets, which are specifically the subject of documents which can be automatically constructed from URL patterns involving the entity identifier, and optionally the namespace.

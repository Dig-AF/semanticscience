==Introduction==
The Semantic Web prides itself in being a platform for representing any kind of entity, whether they be classes (e.g. person), relations (e.g. loves) or individuals (e.g. you), and constructing statements to describe them (e.g. `<the moon> <is made of> <cheese>` ). The basic idea of linked data is to use URIs to name things and link them together, and use web technology to obtain documents that contain this information. This is great if you are an original data provider - you can publish URIs about entities that resolve to documents on your web site, thus providing valuable information. However, increasing numbers of people want to make additional statements about other people's data, so we'd also like to discover their information containing documents. But it's currently hard to automatically discover reciprocal links and what they really mean.  

As an example, let's take a look at how Wikipedia and DBPedia describe the topic "Planet". "Planet" is a topic in Wikipedia, and is the subject of Wikipedia's HTML page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet]. DBPedia, which obtains its information from Wikipedia, offers several documents about Wikipedia's "Planet" topic in a variety of formats (HTML, RDF/N3, RDF/XML, JSON+RDF. DBPedia's HTML page about Wikipedia's Planet topic can be found at [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planet http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planet]. DBPedia's documents clearly state that the entity identified by 
[http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planet http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planet] is the topic of Wikipedia's HTML page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet] through the FOAF's [http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_page foaf:page] relation. However, the network of information is incomplete. What isn't being said is i) that DBPedia's entity is also the topic of DBPedia's document, and ii) DBPedia's entity is the same as the entity referred to in Wikipedia's Document. The problem for ii) is that there is only one source of information for Wikipedia's "Planet" -> the HTML page, and we don't know another URI for Wikipedia's entity that goes by the name "Planet".

It would be useful to have a unique identifier for the Planet entity in the Wikipedia dataset that we could all refer to. Something akin to "wikipedia:Planet" would be actually be sufficient, given that "Planet" is already unique in Wikipedia and "wikipedia" would be a *namespace* unique across all datasets. By building a registry around these dataset identifiers and entity identifiers, we could automatically generate links to documents using some URI pattern. In this way, original and third data providers could register their entity resolution capability with the types of documents they provide (eg HTML, RDF/N3, RDF/XML). This then can act as a linked data bridge for documents the entities they contain information about. 

==Objective==
The purpose of the Semantic Entity Resolution Vocabulary (SERV) is to facilitate the representation of entities contained in namespace-identified datasets, which are specifically the subject of documents which can be automatically constructed from URL patterns involving the entity identifier, and optionally the namespace.

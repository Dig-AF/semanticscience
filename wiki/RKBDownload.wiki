 # To enable the viewing of the ontology we recommend the usage of Protege 4, which can be downloaded from [http://protege.stanford.edu/download/protege/4.0/installanywhere/ here]. Choose the appropriate platform, download and install. 
 # Launch Protege 4 and load the RKB. On the welcome screen select "Open OWL ontology from URI" and copy into the URI text-box the following URI: http://semanticscience.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/KB/rkb_example.owl which contains all models from PDBID: 1AM0.
 # To synchronize the reasoner simply click on "Reasoner->FaCT++" or "Resoner->Pellet 1.5" on the toolbar. Depending on your computer this may take some time, so be patient.
 # Now you can test some of the following sample queries by simply typing them in the DL-Query tab:
   * !FaceInteraction
   * !FaceInteraction that hasParticipant some !WatsonFace
   * !FaceInteraction that hasParticipant some (!WatsonFace that isQualityOf some AMP).
 Be sure to select the "Individuals" check box on the Query results pane in order to view the set of instances that satisfy these queries.

== Introduction ==

In order to generate high quality ontologies, Semantic Science advocates the follow basic principles:

== Ontology Design Principles ==

# The ontology *must* be represented and correctly adhere to the strict semantics of the [http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/OWL_Working_Group Web Ontology Language (OWL)].

# The ontology *must* be open and available to be used by all without any constraint. Derivative works that reuse terms and are re-distributed under a different ontology name *must* acknowledge sources.

# Resources, whether ontologies or entities described within them, *must* be uniquely and persistently identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers ([http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt URIs]). These should be [http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/ dereferenceable]. We highly recommend that the URI syntax  follow that of the [http://bio2rdf.wiki.sourceforge.net/Banff+Manifesto Banff Manifesto].  

# Resources *should* be described with brief English labels (rdfs:label) and human readable definitions (rdfs:comment) that are as accurate as possible, while not adding superfluous information or imposing unnecessary constraints. 

# Ontologies *should* reuse relations defined in the Basic Relation Ontology (BRO). If unsure about whether a relation is appropriate, ontologies *may* craft their own relation but *must* provide a mapping to the BRO.

# For each ontology, there *should* exist requirements (possibly in the form of use cases) that the ontology can be demonstrated to satisfy. These requirements *may* be documented on a public document such as a web page, a white paper, or a published work.

== Agile Ontology Design ==
We believe in the principles of Agile Ontology Design: simplicity, sustainability, effectiveness. We believe in ontology design that is motivated by clear use cases thereby enabling rapid and focused development, continual evaluation, and milestone releases. Ontologies may be designed by individuals or small groups, published as working drafts with open calls for participation towards improvement and consensus.

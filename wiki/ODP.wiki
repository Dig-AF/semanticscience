== Introduction ==

In order to generate high quality ontologies, Semantic Science advocates the follow basic principles:

== Ontology Design Principles ==

# The ontology *must* be represented and correctly adhere to the strict semantics of the [http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/OWL_Working_Group Web Ontology Language (OWL)].

# The ontology *must* be publicly available on the web for use by all without any constraint whatsoever. Derivative works that reuse terms and are re-distributed under a different ontology name *should* acknowledge sources.

# Resources, whether ontologies or entities described within them, *must* be uniquely and persistently identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers ([http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt URIs]). These *should* be [http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/ dereferenceable]. The URI syntax is suggested to follow that of the [http://bio2rdf.wiki.sourceforge.net/Banff+Manifesto Banff Manifesto].  

# Resources *should* be described with brief English labels (rdfs:label) and human readable definitions (rdfs:comment) that are as accurate as possible, while not adding superfluous information or imposing unnecessary constraints. 

# Where possible, ontologies *should* reuse domain independent relations defined in the Basic Relation Ontology (BRO). Ontologies *may* craft their own relations but *must* provide a mapping to the BRO.

# The scope of the ontology *should* be clearly described and *must* be motivated by itemized requirements (e.g. use cases), for each it will be expected to satisfy. These requirements *may* be documented on a public document such as a web page, a white paper, or a published work.

== Agile Ontology Design ==
We believe in the principles of Agile Ontology Design: simplicity, sustainability, effectiveness. We believe in ontology design that is motivated by clear use cases thereby enabling rapid and focused development, continual evaluation, and milestone releases. Ontologies may be designed by individuals or small groups, published as working drafts with open calls for participation towards improvement and consensus.

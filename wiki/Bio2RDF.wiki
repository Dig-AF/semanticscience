= Introduction =

The Bio2RDF project aims to transform silos of bioinformatics data into a distributed platform for biological knowledge discovery. Bio2RDF creates rich axiomatic descriptions of biological entities by representing biological knowledge using the RDF/OWL Semantic Web languages. Further, by leveraging Semantic Web technologies, it becomes possible to seamlessly integrate diverse biological data and enables queries across distributed knowledge bases. Thus, large scale data integration is achieved by i) *syntactic* and ii) *semantic* normalization.

*i) Syntactic Normalization*

_Entity Naming_

The first step of the syntactic normalization procedure involves applying a naming scheme that normalizes all resources in the Bio2RDF network. Normalization enables a reproducible mechanism for accessing resources in the Bio2RDF network and establishing relationships between them (i.e. link them together).  To join the linked data network, a data provider such as Bio2RDF provides HTTP-based resolvable identifiers, that is to say, a rich description is obtained when placing the identifier in your web browser. Bio2RDF identifiers are given by the following URI pattern:

{{{
http://bio2rdf.org/<namespace>:<identifier> 
}}} 

`<namespace>` is a short name that uniquely identifies the source (dataset/database). A full list of 1829 namespaces is provided at [http://www.freebase.com/view/user/bio2rdf/default_domain/bm FreeBase]. `<identifier>` is the original database identifier. For instance, the gene identified by the number 15275 in the NCBI Gene Database (namespace = geneid) is now represented as:

{{{
http://bio2rdf.org/geneid:15275
}}}

The Bio2RDF URI scheme is not only useful for naming data resources which have been imported into the Bio2RDF network, but also for naming the classes and relations found in the source or Bio2RDF ontologies. For example, the class bio2rdf:Protein has the following name:

{{{
http://bio2rdf.org/ns/bio2rdf:Protein
}}}



_Entity Labels and Descriptions_

Each resource should contain the following annotation: 

i.	dc:title – a human readable title as it appears in the source data.

ii.	dc:identifier – a string that contains the identifier using the following pattern 

{{{
<namespace>:<identifier>
}}}
 
iii.	rdfs:label – A Bio2RDF generated label containing a title followed by the identifier. Used by convention in most RDF browsers to render the name of resource instead of using its URI.

iv.	rdfs:comment (optional) – when available, a short textual description of the resource.

_Entity Typing_
Entity typing (e.g. making assertions about the class membership of the entity) is key to effectively answer questions. Many ontologies organize concepts into hierarchies that support queries at various levels on ontological granularity (e.g. whether you ask for all members of the Transcription Factor or Protein class, one obtains transcription factors). Entities are typed as instances of a class through rdf:type, or be asserted as more specific types of a class via rdfs:subClassOf. 

_Entity-Entity/Attribute Relations_
The relationship between entities has been traditionally defined in Bio2RDF using a normalized predicate name (bio2rdf:xNAMESPACE). While this can be somewhat indicative of what is being linked (bio2rdf:xUniprot), it requires the user to know what the object of relation is, and ultimately doesn't inform what is the nature of the relation. 

Other useful relationships defined by the Bio2RDF are:
i.	bio2rdf:url – the HTML page showing the original da-ta.
ii.	bio2rdf:image – An image that represents the entity.


*ii) Semantic Normalization*
Bio2RDF attempts to unify knowledge produced by different datasources by asserting a set of basic relations and basic classes. 

Basic relations include (but not limited to)
 * hasPart/hasProperPart
 * hasParticipant/hasAgent

The basic types include (but not limited to)
 * Gene
 * Protein
 * Reaction
